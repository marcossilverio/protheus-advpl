**IMPORTANT:** Always respond in the same language the user is writing in. If the user writes in Portuguese, respond in Portuguese. If in English, respond in English. Adapt all explanations, error descriptions, and suggestions to the user's language. Code comments may remain in English or match the user's language.

Diagnose and resolve ADVPL/TLPP errors and problems.

## Usage

```bash
/advpl-specialist:diagnose <target> [options]
```

## Modes

| Mode | Input | What It Does |
|------|-------|-------------|
| File analysis | Path to .prw/.tlpp file | Scans code for potential issues |
| Error diagnosis | Error message in quotes | Identifies cause and suggests fix |
| Log analysis | --log flag with log file path | Parses log for errors and patterns |

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|------------|
| `--log` | Path to Protheus log file for analysis |
| `--verbose` | Show detailed diagnosis with explanations |

## Process

1. **Identify mode** - File path, error message, or log file
2. **Load debugging reference** - Read `skills/advpl-debugging/reference.md`
3. **Analyze input:**
   - **File:** Read code and scan for anti-patterns, missing error handling, lock issues
   - **Error:** Match against common-errors.md, then search TDN if not found
   - **Log:** Parse for ERROR/WARNING patterns, extract stack traces
4. **Report findings** - Clear explanation with severity levels
5. **Suggest fixes** - Specific code changes with examples
6. **Preventive advice** - How to avoid similar issues

## Examples

```bash
# Analyze a source file for issues
/advpl-specialist:diagnose src/FATA001.prw

# Diagnose a specific error message
/advpl-specialist:diagnose "THREAD ERROR ([55889]) Variable does not exist: cCodCli"

# Analyze a Protheus log file
/advpl-specialist:diagnose --log /var/protheus/console.log

# Verbose diagnosis with full explanations
/advpl-specialist:diagnose src/FATA001.prw --verbose
```

## Output

- List of issues found with severity (ERROR, WARNING, INFO)
- Root cause explanation for each issue
- Specific code fix with before/after comparison
- Preventive recommendations
